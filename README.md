This monorepo contains pareto generators, they are meant to be used in the context of pareto project builder. These generators generate code and integrations based on the pareto schema file.

Currently the schema file is located at `.pareto/schema.json` in any pareto project. We're planning to change to using `.pareto/schema.zmodel` in the near future. Later, we will be using pareto's own DSL.
